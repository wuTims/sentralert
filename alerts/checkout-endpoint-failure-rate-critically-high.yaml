justification: Production data shows /checkout endpoint with 37.2% failure rate (90
  failures out of 242 transactions). Root cause identified as 'payment token missing'
  errors (90 instances). P95 latency is 1159ms indicating potential downstream service
  issues. With 242 transactions in 24h, this represents significant customer impact.
