thresholds:
  warning: 5.0
  critical: 15.0
justification: Production data shows /api/orders endpoint with 38.2% failure rate
  (55 transactions, multiple LookupError occurrences). While this endpoint is marked
  as monitored in codebase, alerts not configured for this elevated failure rate.
  Likely related to OrderService database queries without proper error handling.
